    Have you ever wondered how it would feel to be scared every single day of your life, well i do, welcome to my world. I can still remember the first time he hit me. I don't remember what I did, or why he did it. But I do remember the soft embrace after, feeling his tears and remorse as he held me in his arms. I also remember believing him. I don't think it happened like this ever again, him being so sorry. After that it was always my fault, both him and I believing this lie. I hadn't really seen it coming, the physical abuse that is, however if you ask my mother she would tell you the truth, that it was always going to be that way, right from the start.

    I believe that God has a plan for all that follow Him. We are all placed here on this earth through reasoning that it is Gods plan. It is up to us to figure out our own purpose for living. We must all try to find our calling and live out our lives to its fullest through His plan. We have to understand that God is the only one that can help us seek our true purpose. "Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future‚Äù (Jeremiah 29:11). What this means to me is that if I follow Him and His plan, things will always be great.
